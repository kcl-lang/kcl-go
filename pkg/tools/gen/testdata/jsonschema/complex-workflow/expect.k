        The name of the GitHub event that triggers the workflow. You can provide a single event string, array of events, array of event types, or an event configuration map that schedules a workflow or restricts the execution of a workflow to specific files, tags, or branch changes. For a list of available events, see https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows.

    concurrency : str | WorkflowConcurrencyOneOf1, optional
        Concurrency ensures that only a single job or workflow using the same concurrency group will run at a time. A concurrency group can be any string or expression. The expression can use any context except for the secrets context. 
        You can also specify concurrency at the workflow level. 
        When a concurrent job or workflow is queued, if another job or workflow using the same concurrency group in the repository is in progress, the queued job or workflow will be pending. Any previously pending job or workflow in the concurrency group will be canceled. To also cancel any currently running job or workflow in the same concurrency group, specify cancel-in-progress: true.
    jobs : WorkflowJobs, required
        A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs. Jobs run in parallel by default. To run jobs sequentially, you can define dependencies on other jobs using the jobs.<job_id>.needs keyword.
        Each job runs in a fresh instance of the virtual environment specified by runs-on.
        You can run an unlimited number of jobs as long as you are within the workflow usage limits. For more information, see https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#usage-limits.

        Expressions in an if conditional do not require the ${{ }} syntax. For more information, see https://help.github.com/en/articles/contexts-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions.
    steps : [WorkflowJobsPatternProperties0OneOf0StepsItems0], optional
        A job contains a sequence of tasks called steps. Steps can run commands, run setup tasks, or run an action in your repository, a public repository, or an action published in a Docker registry. Not all steps run actions, but all actions run as a step. Each step runs in its own process in the virtual environment and has access to the workspace and filesystem. Because steps run in their own process, changes to environment variables are not preserved between steps. GitHub provides built-in steps to set up and complete a job.

    "timeout-minutes" : float, optional, default is 360
        The maximum number of minutes to let a workflow run before GitHub automatically cancels it. Default: 360
    strategy : WorkflowJobsPatternProperties0OneOf0Strategy, optional
        A strategy creates a build matrix for your jobs. You can define different variations of an environment to run each job in.
    "continue-on-error" : bool | str, optional
        Prevents a workflow run from failing when a job fails. Set to true to allow a workflow run to pass when this job fails.
    container : str | WorkflowJobsPatternProperties0OneOf0ContainerOneOf1, optional
        A container to run any steps in a job that don't already specify a container. If you have steps that use both script and container actions, the container actions will run as sibling containers on the same network with the same volume mounts.
        If you do not set a container, all steps will run directly on the host specified by runs-on unless a step refers to an action configured to run in a container.
    services : WorkflowJobsPatternProperties0OneOf0Services, optional
        Additional containers to host services for a job in a workflow. These are useful for creating databases or cache services like redis. The runner on the virtual machine will automatically create a network and manage the life cycle of the service containers.
        When you use a service container for a job or your step uses container actions, you don't need to set port information to access the service. Docker automatically exposes all ports between containers on the same network.
        When both the job and the action run in a container, you can directly reference the container by its hostname. The hostname is automatically mapped to the service name.
        When a step does not use a container action, you must access the service using localhost and bind the ports.
    concurrency : str | WorkflowJobsPatternProperties0OneOf0ConcurrencyOneOf1, optional
        Concurrency ensures that only a single job or workflow using the same concurrency group will run at a time. A concurrency group can be any string or expression. The expression can use any context except for the secrets context. 
        You can also specify concurrency at the workflow level. 
        When a concurrent job or workflow is queued, if another job or workflow using the same concurrency group in the repository is in progress, the queued job or workflow will be pending. Any previously pending job or workflow in the concurrency group will be canceled. To also cancel any currently running job or workflow in the same concurrency group, specify cancel-in-progress: true.

    name : str, optional
        A name for your step to display on GitHub.
    uses : str, optional
        Selects an action to run as part of a step in your job. An action is a reusable unit of code. You can use an action defined in the same repository as the workflow, a public repository, or in a published Docker container image (https://hub.docker.com/).
        We strongly recommend that you include the version of the action you are using by specifying a Git ref, SHA, or Docker tag number. If you don't specify a version, it could break your workflows or cause unexpected behavior when the action owner publishes an update.
        - Using the commit SHA of a released action version is the safest for stability and security.
        - Using the specific major action version allows you to receive critical fixes and security patches while still maintaining compatibility. It also assures that your workflow should still work.
        - Using the master branch of an action may be convenient, but if someone releases a new major version with a breaking change, your workflow could break.
        Some actions require inputs that you must set using the with keyword. Review the action's README file to determine the inputs required.
        Actions are either JavaScript files or Docker containers. If the action you're using is a Docker container you must run the job in a Linux virtual environment. For more details, see https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions.
    run : str, optional
        Runs command-line programs using the operating system's shell. If you do not provide a name, the step name will default to the text specified in the run command.
        Commands run using non-login shells by default. You can choose a different shell and customize the shell used to run commands. For more information, see https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-a-specific-shell.
        Each run keyword represents a new process and shell in the virtual environment. When you provide multi-line commands, each line runs in the same shell.
    "working-directory" : str, optional
        Using the working-directory keyword, you can specify the working directory of where to run the command.
    shell : any, optional
        You can override the default shell settings in the runner's operating system using the shell keyword. You can use built-in shell keywords, or you can define a custom set of shell options.

    pull_request_target : WorkflowOnOneOf2PullRequestTargetOneOf0 | str | WorkflowOnOneOf2PullRequestTarget, optional
        This event is similar to pull_request, except that it runs in the context of the base repository of the pull request, rather than in the merge commit. This means that you can more safely make your secrets available to the workflows triggered by the pull request, because only workflows defined in the commit on the base repository are run. For example, this event allows you to create workflows that label and comment on pull requests, based on the contents of the event payload.
    push : WorkflowOnOneOf2PushOneOf0 | str | WorkflowOnOneOf2Push, optional
        Runs your workflow when someone pushes to a repository branch, which triggers the push event.
        Note: The webhook payload available to GitHub Actions does not include the added, removed, and modified attributes in the commit object. You can retrieve the full commit object using the REST API. For more information, see https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/#get-a-single-commit.
    registry_package : WorkflowOnOneOf2RegistryPackageOneOf0 | str | WorkflowOnOneOf2RegistryPackage, optional

    workflow_call : WorkflowOnOneOf2WorkflowCall, optional
        Allows workflows to be reused by other workflows.
    workflow_dispatch : WorkflowOnOneOf2WorkflowDispatch, optional
        You can now create workflows that are manually triggered with the new workflow_dispatch event. You will then see a 'Run workflow' button on the Actions tab, enabling you to easily trigger a run.
    workflow_run : WorkflowOnOneOf2WorkflowRunOneOf0 | str | WorkflowOnOneOf2WorkflowRun, optional
        This event occurs when a workflow run is requested or completed, and allows you to execute a workflow based on the finished result of another workflow. For example, if your pull_request workflow generates build artifacts, you can create a new workflow that uses workflow_run to analyze the results and add a comment to the original pull request.
    repository_dispatch : WorkflowOnOneOf2RepositoryDispatchOneOf0 | str, optional
        You can use the GitHub API to trigger a webhook event called repository_dispatch when you want to trigger a workflow for activity that happens outside of GitHub. For more information, see https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create-a-repository-dispatch-event.
        To trigger the custom repository_dispatch webhook event, you must send a POST request to a GitHub API endpoint and provide an event_type name to describe the activity type. To trigger a workflow run, you must also configure your workflow to use the repository_dispatch event.
    schedule : [WorkflowOnOneOf2ScheduleItems0], optional
        You can schedule a workflow to run at specific UTC times using POSIX cron syntax (https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/crontab.html#tag_20_25_07). Scheduled workflows run on the latest commit on the default or base branch. The shortest interval you can run scheduled workflows is once every 5 minutes.
        Note: GitHub Actions does not support the non-standard syntax @yearly, @monthly, @weekly, @daily, @hourly, and @reboot.
        You can use crontab guru (https://crontab.guru/). to help generate your cron syntax and confirm what time it will run. To help you get started, there is also a list of crontab guru examples (https://crontab.guru/examples.html).

    branches : [str], optional
        When using the push and pull_request events, you can configure a workflow to run on specific branches or tags. If you only define only tags or only branches, the workflow won't run for events affecting the undefined Git ref.
        The branches, branches-ignore, tags, and tags-ignore keywords accept glob patterns that use the * and ** wildcard characters to match more than one branch or tag name. For more information, see https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#filter-pattern-cheat-sheet.
        The patterns defined in branches and tags are evaluated against the Git ref's name. For example, defining the pattern mona/octocat in branches will match the refs/heads/mona/octocat Git ref. The pattern releases/** will match the refs/heads/releases/10 Git ref.
        You can use two types of filters to prevent a workflow from running on pushes and pull requests to tags and branches:
        - branches or branches-ignore - You cannot use both the branches and branches-ignore filters for the same event in a workflow. Use the branches filter when you need to filter branches for positive matches and exclude branches. Use the branches-ignore filter when you only need to exclude branch names.
        - tags or tags-ignore - You cannot use both the tags and tags-ignore filters for the same event in a workflow. Use the tags filter when you need to filter tags for positive matches and exclude tags. Use the tags-ignore filter when you only need to exclude tag names.
        You can exclude tags and branches using the ! character. The order that you define patterns matters.
        - A matching negative pattern (prefixed with !) after a positive match will exclude the Git ref.

    This event is similar to pull_request, except that it runs in the context of the base repository of the pull request, rather than in the merge commit.
